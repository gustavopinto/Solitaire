This  project serves different purposes:
* finding one or all solutions of the (pin or peg) solitaire game in reasonable time
* practising software development (like a slightly bigger Code Kata)
* getting used to some features of Java7

The first implementation will use Java7 and is developed with the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA version 10.5.2.

For the optimized version you need trove: http://sourceforge.net/projects/trove4j/develop
It seems to be much faster and much more memory efficient than ArrayList.
To avoid an out of memory error for the optimized version you should use at least one gig of memory: -Xmx1G
