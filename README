This  project serves different purposes:
* finding one or all solutions of the (pin or peg) solitaire game in reasonable time
* practising software development (like a slightly bigger Code Kata)
* getting used to some features of Java7

The first implementation will use Java7 and is developed with the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA version 10.5.2.
